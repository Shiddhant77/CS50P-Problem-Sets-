#
# [
#     "January",
#     "February",
#     "March",
#     "April",
#     "May",
#     "June",
#     "July",
#     "August",
#     "September",
#     "October",
#     "November",
#     "December"
# ]
# Then output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the userâ€™s input is not a valid date in either format, prompt the user again. Assume that every month has no more than 31 days; no need to validate whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
#
# Hints
# Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods, including split.
# Recall that a list comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists, among which is index.
# Note that you can format an int with leading zeroes with code like
# print(f"{n:02}")
# wherein, if n is a single digit, it will be prefixed with one 0, per docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax.
